# README Metrics Placeholder (Unverified)

Repository root does not currently include a README with finance KPI statements.

Status:

- README-stated metrics: unavailable / unverified in this repository clone.
- Notebook-derived metrics are available in `finance/metrics_extracted.json`.

To add README-based KPI verification later:

1. Add finance README at repo root or `finance/README.md`.
2. Include explicit metric values and notebook references.
3. Re-run extraction and update `finance.html` KPI cards.
